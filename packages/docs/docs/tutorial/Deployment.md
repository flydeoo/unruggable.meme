here is what you need to know about this form:

- `Symbol`: the symbol of your memecoin like `CMT`
- `Owner Address`: probably it's best to put `your starknet wallet address` there. (by clicking the wallet logo, it will fill with your connected wallet address.) 
- `Initial Supply`: the supply of your memecoin like `21,000,000`
