### Anti bot
next step is to set anti bot (hold limit). you know that bots are everywhere and if they spot a new pool in one of the AMMs, they probably buy a big portion of that token before users notice that. so it's totally up to you to use this feature.

> e.g. %1 for 24:00 means no single wallet can buy more than 1% of the token for 24 hours after launch from the AMM. After that time, this limit vanishes.
